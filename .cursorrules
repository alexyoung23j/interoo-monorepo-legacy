Any time you use tailwind to provide colors, you must use the theme colors

theme-50: #F5F7F7
theme-100: #D5DDE1
theme-200: #B2C1C7
theme-300: #89A0AA
theme-400: #748E99
theme-500: #587785
theme-600: #426473
theme-700: #2F505F
theme-800: #28424E
theme-900: #1E3038
theme-off-white: #FDFCFD

Generally, if text is dark, it should be using theme-900, and if text is white it should use theme-off-white.


When you write components, always explicitly use flexbox styling (with tailwind)

ALWAYS WRITE THE ENTIRE FILE WHEN YOU CAN!!!!

Always prefer using ?? over || when accessing values in JS/TS. This is because || will not work with null or undefined, while ?? will.
